This repository aims to not only animate a matrix of linear actuators, but to randomly generate them simulating various patterns.

## Sources of Variance

- Size of matrix
- Connectedness between any two matrix cells
- Animation
  - Speed
  - Direction
  - Noise
- Color
  - Solid colors
  - Changes with height
  - Changes with phase
  - Changes with height and phase
  - Transparency
  - Stroke
  - Velocity and acceleration of phases (varying colorMode)
